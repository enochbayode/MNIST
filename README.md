# MNIST
Take input image and correctly determines which number is shown in that image 

The MNIST dataset is a benchmark dataset widely used in the field of computer vision for handwritten digit recognition tasks. It consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). Each image is labeled with the corresponding digit it represents. The dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. MNIST serves as a standard dataset for evaluating machine learning algorithms, particularly for tasks involving image classification and digit recognition.
